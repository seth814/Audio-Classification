            <p>The robot clicked disapprovingly, gurgled briefly inside its 
            cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid.
            "Sir, you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkard's grave, dead of 
            hepatic cirrhosis," it informed me virtuously as it returned my ID 
            card. I glared as I pushed the glass across the table.</p>

            <p>The alarm went off at exactly 6:00 AM as it had every morning for 
            the past five years. Barbara began her morning and was ready to eat
            breakfast by 7:00 AM. The day appeared to be as normal as any other,
            but that was about to change. In fact, it was going to change at
            exactly 7:23 AM.</p>
